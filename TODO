Todo to make the thing work
- Scan timer logic (https://docs.wxpython.org/wx.Timer.html)
- Toolbar to select the filters for POTA - BAND DONE, NEED MODE
- All the rigctl stuff
- Settings?
- Fix Scroll Bar (Sort of working, but needs more tweaking - doesn't shrink when items are removed)
[...] (Incomplete)

Todo for the future
- Proper MVC
- Spot class to support future other integrations (SOTA, DXCluster, etc)
- Remove direct use of POTA JSON from biz logic
- Cleanup all that GUI code into something nicer
- Settings?
