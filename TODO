Todo to make the thing work
- Dedupe spots - for some reason the POTA API returns many dupes
- Scroll Bar (Sort of working, but needs more tweaking)
- Subclass the widget to add biz logic to the spot (and completely ignore MVC??)
- Scan logic
- Toolbar to select the filters for POTA - BAND DONE, NEED MODE
- All the rigctl stuff
- Settings?
[...] (Incomplete)

Todo for the future
- Proper MVC
- Spot class to support future other integrations (SOTA, DXCluster, etc)
- Remove direct use of POTA JSON from biz logic
- Cleanup all that GUI code into something nicer
- Settings?
