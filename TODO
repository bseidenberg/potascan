Todo to make the thing work
- Toolbar to select the filters for POTA
- Refresh button for spots
- Scroll Bar
- Subclass the widget to add biz logic to the spot (and completely ignore MVC)
- Scan logic
- All the rigctl stuff
- Settings?
[...] (Incomplete)

Todo for the future
- Spot class to support future other integrations (SOTA, DXCluster, etc)
- Remove direct use of POTA JSON
- Cleanup all that GUI code into something nicer
- Settings?
